Abstract Background: The COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdown measures have led to increasing mental health concerns in the general population. Objective: We aimed to assess the short-term impact of the pandemic lockdown on mental health and emergency service use in the Kitchener-Waterloo region of Ontario.  Methods: We conducted an observational study using National Ambulatory Care Reporting System metadata from psychiatric assessments at three regional hospitals, mental health and substance related calls to Waterloo Regional Police, and calls to a central mental health crisis telephone line during pandemic lockdown, comparing these volumes with the same period in 2019.  Results: Between March 5 and September 5, 2020, there was a marked reduction in all categories of psychiatric emergency visits, when compared to the same period in 2019.  Conclusions:  Keywords: COVID-19, lockdown, pandemic, psychiatric emergency
